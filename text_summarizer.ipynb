    "+ Is a simple library used for extracting summary from HTML pages or plain texts\n",
    "+ The package also contains simple evaluation framework for text summaries\n",

    "\n",
    "+ To build an extractive text summarizer highlighting the key points of the article\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Import libraries and data\n",
    "+ Create a function to wrap the text and easier to read\n",
    "+ Build the summarizer and parser using sumy packages\n",
    "+ Add them to the dataframe\n",
    "+ Clean the data and remove unwanted or unnecessary character\n",

    "### What is VADER?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media. (All credits go to https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is it scored?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ The compound score is computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive). This is the most useful metric if you want a single unidimensional measure of sentiment for a given sentence. Calling it a 'normalized, weighted composite score' is accurate.

    "### What is KeyBERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "+ KeyBERT is a minimal and easy-to-use keyword extraction technique that leverages BERT embeddings to create keywords and keyphrases that are most similar to a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Document embeddings are extracted with BERT to get document-level representation\n",
    "2. Word embeddings are then extracted for N-gram words/phrases\n",
    "3. Cosine similarity is then used to find the words that are most similar to the document\n",
